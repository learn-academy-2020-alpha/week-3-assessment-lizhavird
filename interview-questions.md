1. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Object destructuring is the act of re-iterating the value of an object locally within a function, so you do not have to continuously call it. 

  Researched answer:
  
Object destructuring allows us to extract data from arrays, objects, maps and sets into their own variable. It allows us to extract properties from an object or items from an array, multiple at a time.

  Your answer:
  .map can access objects, arrays, and variables.

4. What is the difference between a HTML div and a span?

  Your answer:
  
   i'm pretty sure div is sort for division? and by writing code inside of the div you are calling elements from other languages to incorporate into your html. also i think the div is the only place you are able to call other languages.
  
  i'm not really sure what span is.

  Researched answer:
  
  the difference between span and div is that a span element is in-line and usually used for a small chunk of HTML inside a line (such as inside a paragraph) whereas a div (division) element is block-line (which is basically equivalent to having a line-break before and after it) and used to group larger chunks of code.
